# GSoC 2019 (Proposal)

## Ideas

There is a list of ideas discussed in the email:

- Converters
  * Between TeXmacs and OpenOffice/LibreOffice/M$Office.
  * Extending the HTML converters to HTML 5.
- Language tools
  * Automatic grammar checking
  * Built-in translation facilities (could be interface to Google translate).
- Further improvement of blibliographic tools:
  * Direct searching of bib entries on the web from within TeXmacs.
  * Automatic linking of authors to homepages, bib entries to Pdfs, etc.
  * Preview of link targets in help balloons.
- Plugins
  * integrate jupyter interface
- Scheme
  * port TeXmacs to Guile 2 (or make the scheme code independent of the specific scheme system, while avoiding perfomance regressions)
- GUI
  * develop an experimental wkwidgets port to evaluate transition to that library
- Graphics
  * improve the drawing system, maybe evaluate also possible alternative for a (canonical, standard) procedural graphics system (like tikz or metapost) to  be included in TeXmacs (the reason is that some graphs are more meaningfully programmed than drawn via the UI
- Markdown
  * Converters for Markdown format
  * Markdown plugins

There are more ideas available in the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/texmacs/Lobby) chat room. You are welcome to come up with new ideas and discuss with us.
